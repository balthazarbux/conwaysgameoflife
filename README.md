# Conway's Game of Life

This game literally has trillions of python implementations and they're probably
better than mine, but fuck it, I'm bored.

## Gameplay

`./main.py`

## Random seed

manually set the random seed (self.seed on line 11 of game.py) with one of these
for some semi-interesting results:

    647, 238, 859, 554, 948, 917, 477, 342, 287, 305, 141, 56, 94, 125,
    857, 837, 159, 649

### Requirements

  - numpy
